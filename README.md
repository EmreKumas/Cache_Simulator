This *C* project is a **cache simulation of a CPU** containing L1D, L1I and L2 caches. It takes an **image of memory** and a **memory trace** as input, simulates the **hit/miss behavior** of a cache memory on this trace, and outputs the total number of hits, misses and evictions for each cache type along with the content of each cache at the end.

It takes command-line arguments about the information of wanted CPU caches. Detailed explanations are in **cachelab.pdf** file. Also I included the RAM.dat image file.

If you are reading this file, most probably you know how to compile this C program and execute it. But if you don't know it, I have a *Wiki page* for you to be with US. **Visit it**.
